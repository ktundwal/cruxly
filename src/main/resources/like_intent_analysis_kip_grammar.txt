# Like Intent (Like) with KIP-awareness
# vers 0.5
# Author: A. Guha

# Suffixes/prefixes:
# _X - reference members of alias named X
# X* - X repeated zero or more times
# X+ - X repeated one or more times
# X? - X repeated zero or once
# X^ - anything EXCEPT X

# GR mP: refers to mth positive grammar rule
# GR mN: refers to mth negative grammar rule
# Initial scores are based on KIP not being identified as the object NP

# KIP: defined as alias of keywords. Intent will be detected if it is on the KIP
#     more than one KIP is allowed at this time
#     if KIP is null string "", then KIP will be ignored in the intent detection

# Rules: KIP-aware rules are written such that if KIP <> null, it is detected at specific locations in the rule
#        All intent rules are written to account for KIP, unless they can be KIP independent, in few cases

# Initially, KIP hardcoded for testing. In later versions, KIP will be set by other analytics loop in general.
# Do we include "I/We want/need/BI the? one/it/that? now?" "IWe am/are getting it/one/that"
